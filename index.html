<h2>Welcome to Oaktown Football Club</h2>
			<p>Oaktown’s local football club plays every weekend during the football season.<br> We are very much a family orientated club with a strong focus on friendly competition and strong sporting ethics. We strive to provide opportunities for all members to develop their soccer skills in a supportive yet friendly team environment.</p>
		<!--added line break in the code here for easier readability-->
			<p>The club was founded in 1978 and has had a strong membership ever since.<br>We welcome new members and are always looking for volunteers to coach, help run the canteen and generally help out during the season.</p>
