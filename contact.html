		This was my second attempt at question 5 - I understand the idea of using inner html now, but I still wasn't sure which paragraph to change and how I could include it on the Contact page. Also, the Jquery seemed to be interferring with my manual javascript error checks and alerts so I commented the link out!
		
		I tried  to use the j-query and inner html to create the error descriptions. however, i was finding that the jquery was creating problems with the javascript code I wrote myself (I am not sure exactly why but I think it was automatically checking the email field so my own alert messages weren't coming up properly until I commented it out!)  I commented out the jquery links in order for all my alert messages to show up on the contact page. I have left the alert messages instead of trying to use the inner html error description as I couldn't make both work and I was unsure which paragraph I should be trying to change -->
